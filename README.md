Wee-Scope is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, Machine Learning powered Bio-Tech Product that is:

  - Cheaper than Present Alternatives
  - Light-Weight and Portable
  - High Resolution with 1000x Magnification.
  - AI Ready.

# Origin of Wee-Scope

Wee means micro. How did we come upon the idea of Making a Wee-Scope?
It all started with us visiting a veevor village in a NSS camp. We found that couple of children were suffering from diseases and they didn't know what they were suffering from. Upon asking why, we came to know two things.
- There was no proper facilities or doctors available in the village at all times to diagonose advanced diseases.
- Even if they were available the economic conditions of the villagers didn't allow them to avail those Healthcare facilities which they deserved.

Healthcare should be the right of Every Human being. Healthcare isn't a national issue, but a Humanitarian Issue. Our study found that nearly 8 million people die every year because of a lack of access to high-quality care. That is a big problem for 21st century where everyone cares about money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth and going to Mars. 

# Why Wee-Scope?

Why Wee-Scope? Because ours is a AI Ready, Portable and most Importantly a Lot Cheaper than traditional Disease Diagonising Costs, i.e., Cost for diagonising the disease in a Pathology Laboratory, or being able to afford Disease diagonising machines. Not to mention the middle man costs, Such as paying to pathology laboratories and Doctors.

Also the factor of time. When you give your blood to test it takes usually 2-7 days for your results to come back. Our system would cut all the redundant and unwanted cost plus would cut the time required in diagonising the disease. Our system will enable anyone using it to diagonise a disease in mere 15 minutes. That would cut the time required for diagonizing by 1/8th.

# How did we make it, and How much does it cost?

The first iteration of idea came from Manu Prakash's foldscope, as good as it sounded to us the lower resolution and fixation of lens lead to chaos. The basic idea of foldscope is combining 2.6 mm lens to get a magnification of about 140x, however the resolution and magnification was very low even to identify basic diseases.

The second iteration of wee-scope followed by re-desiging the microscope which prove to be expensive than existing one.
Our main focus while making Wee-Scope was to keep the quality of the product durable, Price of the product cheap and accurate which would work as effectively as a traditional microscope. 
It can be made from something as cheap as a thick paper and something as hard as metal pipe. For Demonstration purposes, we made the wee-scope using the cardboard packing of the the Jet Brain Bottle Goodie. We even made a Wee-Scope out of the cover of the notepad given by the Hack-A-Bit.

Our Wee-Scope consist of a tubular structure that can be made out of almost anything you can find your hands on, something as cheap as paper and something as lightweight and strong as a PVC Pipe. At one side of the tube is attached a 10x objective lens which is 2.0 mm in diameter. And another end consists of a 100x spherical Objective. 10x objective multiplied with 100x objective at a specific focal length gives us 1000x Magnification. After much trial and error we found out the perfect Focal length for this two objectives was 20 cms. Our design diagram can be seen below.

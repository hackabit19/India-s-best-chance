# Origin of Wee-Scope

Wee means micro. How did we come upon the idea of Making a Wee-Scope?
It all started with us visiting a veevor village in a NSS camp. We found that couple of children were suffering from diseases and they didn't know what they were suffering from. Upon asking why, we came to know two things.
- There was no proper facilities or doctors available in the village at all times to diagonose advanced diseases.
- Even if they were available the economic conditions of the villagers didn't allow them to avail those Healthcare facilities which they deserved.
Healthcare should be the right of Every Human being. Healthcare isn't a national issue, but a Humanitarian Issue. Our study found that nearly 8 million people die every year because of a lack of access to high-quality care. That is a big problem for 21st century where everyone cares about money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth and going to Mars.

# Backend with Anvil.works
Since our project uses GOOGLE COLLAB as the main webapp to classify the image, We needed a way to integrate Google COllab with a user Friendly web app which could be easily used by any user around the world.
Anvil works is an very easy and efficient way of doing the same.
